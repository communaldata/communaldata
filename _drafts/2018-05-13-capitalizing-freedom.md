“To the 53 people who’ve watched A Christmas Prince every day for the past 18 days: Who hurt you?”. I wonder how many people read this Netflix tweet and sighed in relief. Maybe their 7th viewing of Princess Diary wasn’t so bad after all?  There are guilty pleasures you jokily tell your friends about and then there are those you would not dare share with the world. Like the person who played ‘Sorry’ 42 times on Valentine’s Day. Would they have broadcasted this tidbit the way Spotify did when they wrote it on a billboard? 
These marketing campaigns revealed more than just odd user behaviours. They showed us a glimpse of  why we trust Netflix but not our neighbour, the former doesn’t judge. 

Most of us would not invite a salesperson to spend a day on the couch with us. We’d feel watched. Yet we are happy to have our phones with us all day, or Echo on standby. Why? It is convenient having a little box to order groceries from. But, arguably a fully grown human could perform that same role. The difference is that Siri and Alexa don’t judge. Whether you have her buy you milk, or butt plugs she will obey your every wish without so much as a frown. They don’t shame us. We experience the freedom to ask what we never dared to ask, to be another person, to see on a screen the very things that you were previously too ashamed to even think. But this freedom comes at a price.

Our bodies are lying to us. The ping of anxiety we feel when we do something shameful is a distraction.  We have much greater things to fear than our friend’s disapproval. Google will not judge, it needs you to experience an immense sense of freedom. To be your truest self. It’s through this experienced freedom that you will help the company create datasets that allow it to predict future behaviour and nudge you in the direction of its ads and other income generating activities. To coerce you without you feeling coerced.  Or in the words of philosopher Byung-Chul Han: ”Power need not exclude, prohibit, or censor. Not does it stand opposed to freedom. Indeed power can even use freedom to its own end.” It’s not judgement we should fear, but loss of agency.
