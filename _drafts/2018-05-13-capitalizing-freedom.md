description: Freedom can be a lucrative business model, one we pay for with our autonomy.

Why would we not invite a salesperson to spend a day on the couch with us, watching our every move, but we are happy to have Alexa do that exact thing? Yes, Alexa provides a service, but arguably the salesperson would as well. The difference is that Alexa doesn’t judge. Whether you have her buy you milk, or butt plugs she will obey your every wish without so much as a frown. Much like the prostitute who eagerly plays out your wildest and weirdest fantasies. No shame. The freedom to ask what you never dared to ask, to be another person, to see on a screen the very things that you were previously to ashamed to even think. And I’m not just talking about sex. Netflix recently shamed its users, albeit anonymously, by displaying their - some would say absurd - viewing behaviours on big screens around Times Square. In this so-called age of shamelessness, many of us would rather not share these stats, our playlists, or search histories with our closest friends and neighbours. 

But our emotions have not caught up with our new reality. Listening to that one Taylor Swift song a few too many times may open you up to some ridicule (unless your friends are a bunch of preteens), its impact on your live does not warrant the ping of anxiety it may inflict. The tech giants that collect our data play a different game. Don’t expect ridicule from them, do expect them to use your behaviours to steer you in ways that are often invisible. To coerce you without you ever feeling coerced. They gave us immense freedom, at the expense of our autonomy. Or in the words of philosopher Byung-Chul Han: ”Power need not exclude, prohibit, or censor. Not does it stand opposed to freedom. Indeed power can even use freedom to its own end.” We should feel anxious about that, yet instead we go on pretending we have nothing to hide.
