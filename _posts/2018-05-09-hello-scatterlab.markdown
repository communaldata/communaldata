A loud ping alerts me to the arrival of a new job. ‘Locate unboxed fashion items in the image (DON’T FORGET BELT)’ the title reads. I click the link and start tagging unboxed dresses, shoes and, indeed, belts. The job is worth 11,549 HITs, which I soon learn stands for Human Intelligence Tasks and counts the number of human actions it takes to complete it. Every time I finish a HIT, I receive 2 cents.

Today I am one of half a million ‘Turkers’: human beings who trade time and brain cells for money, on a site called Mechanical Turk. The platform, hosted by Amazon, provides companies with a ‘on-demand work force’ for those microtasks that computers are currently unable to perform. The ‘human intelligence’ in HIT thus mostly describes the absence of artificial intelligence (AI), as the repetitive nature of the errands is more likely to put humans to sleep than call on their intellect.

Ironically, by performing these little bursts of human labor, the people involved are essentially working towards their own replacement. Once me and my fellow Turkers complete our HITs, a nascent artificial intelligence (AI) will use the labelled images as index cards. Every time it is presented an image, it will try and guess the unboxed fashion items and check its results with the label. Ultimately it will be able to successfully detect all the items, even in images it has not yet seen. The AI is now mature and ready to be unleashed on the world. About half of all jobs on Mechanical Turk involve the transformation of raw data into structured datasets.

Turkers are not the only people performing HITs. Ever had to prove your humanness to a machine? You most likely solved a reCAPTCHA, the two-worded strings that look like they escaped from a drunk typewriter and are used by websites to guarantee their visitors are not robots. In actuality, a one-word test would suffice, but by typing in a second word you help Google transcribe books. Newer reCAPTCHAS, which include images, are instead designed to help label street signs and categorise objects.

Once you become aware of these HITs in the wild, it’s impossible to un-see them. Take social media for example. Say you were to design the perfect machine to induce human being to voluntarily create and label data. Would it not look an awful lot like platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, or Tinder? The fixed format they provide for creating and reacting to content effectively reduces the range of possible expressions to computer-digestible chunks. Chunks, moreover that are repeatedly created by billions of users, billions of times. While few of us would elect to spend hour upon hour labelling images as ‘good’ or ‘bad’, we are happy to do that exact thing when we swipe left and right on Tinder profiles. Just as we eagerly label Facebook posts as ‘happy’, ‘sad’, ‘angry’ and so on, tag our friends in photos and categorise ourselves by ‘liking’ our various interests and pages. Whether this was intentional or not, social media have successfully gamified HITs* and thereby transformed themselves into highly efficient machines for the recording of structured data.

The generation of structured data is increasingly taking place in the brick and mortar world as well. As our surroundings are coming online, objects ranging from furniture to garbage cans are transformed into data recorders. They turn our habits and routines into structured data, providing the training wheels for the next generation of AI.
